    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply <i>dummy text</i> of the <mark>printing and typesetting industry</mark>. Lorem Ipsum has been the <small>industry's standard dummy text</small> ever since the 1500<sub>s</sub>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <em>electronic typesetting</em>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960<sup>s</sup> with the release of <del>Letraset sheets</del><ins> sheets</ins> containing <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <ins>Aldus PageMaker </ins>including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>

    <p>It is a <b>long established</b> fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a <sub>page</sub> when looking at its <i>layout</i>. <strong>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a <small>cmore-or-less</small> normal distribution of letters</strong>, as opposed to using <em><mark>'Content here, content here'</mark></em>, making it look like readable <ins>us-english </ins> and English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <del>'lorem ipsum'</del> will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <sup>(injected humour and the like).</sup> </p>
